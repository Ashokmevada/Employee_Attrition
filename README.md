# Employee Attrition Prediction Projects

This repository contains the code and documentation for an Employee Attrition Prediction project. The project is designed to predict employee attrition within an organization using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

- **Model & Accuracy**: We have developed a robust  Classifier model with a remarkable 94% accuracy for employee attrition prediction. The project is organized into modular components for easy maintainability.

- **Algorithm Exploration & Optimization**: We extensively explored and optimized various machine learning algorithms, including SVC, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Gaussian Naive Bayes, AdaBoost, and k-Nearest Neighbors. After rigorous hyperparameter tuning, we achieved an impressive 94% accuracy. The codebase is structured with distinct modules for efficient algorithm experimentation.

- **AWS Deployment**: The model has been successfully deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using Elastic Beanstalk, and we've implemented Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline through AWS CodePipeline. This ensures scalability and availability. The deployment process is designed with a modular approach for easy management.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We conducted comprehensive EDA to gain insights into the factors contributing to employee attrition. This analysis provided valuable information for HR and management decision-making. The EDA process is structured in a modular format for clarity and reproducibility. Additionally, we've implemented robust log and exception handling modules for application resilience.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `/src/components`: Contains the codebase, including algorithm implementations.

- `/artifacts`: Stores the datasets used for training and testing the models.

- `/utils`: Contains utility scripts.

- `/logs`: Houses log files for monitoring application performance.

- `/exceptions`: Stores exception files for debugging and error tracking.

- `/notebook` : EDA script
